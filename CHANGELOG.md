## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure, CI pipeline, and developer tooling.
- HTML renderer producing a self-contained, bilingual memory page with
  photos embedded as base64 data URIs and an inline elevation-profile SVG
  (`trailstory.renderers.html.render_html`, `templates/memory.html.j2`).
- `trailstory generate` CLI: orchestrates the full pipeline (GPX → photos
  → narrative → HTML) with Rich progress output, `--photos`, `--gpx`,
  `--seed`, `--name`, `--age`, `--out`, and `--location` options.
